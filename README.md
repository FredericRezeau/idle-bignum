# idle-bignum

idle-bignum is a very small, fast, big number library for incremental and idle games in javascript.

## Introduction

If you are looking for a simple solution to handle big numbers above the javascript limit of 1.79E+308 (MAX_VALUE) for your next incremental game then idle-bignum is what you need.

> Note: The class names powers of ten using the [Conway-Wechsler System](http://mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html#conway-wechsler) (e.g. 10^261 is named sexoctogintillion).

I have used this class in the incremental game **Idle Brainz**. A demo is available [here](https://play.litemint.com/demo/idlebrainz/).
